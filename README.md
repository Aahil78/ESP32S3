# ESP32S3

This is a custom ESP32-S3 based Developement board.

# Idea
    - A custom, modular, and easy to use devboard
    - Has built-in components for IoT applications
    - Open sourced hardware and software
    - Easy to create
    - Type-C interface
    - And more

#2 NOTE: This is still a wip, new features and files will be added, there is no garuntee of stability, files still to be added.

# Design
This project is designed in EasyEDA Pro, and uses basic components. It uses the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 Module, an LDO, RGB LED(SK6812), OLED Display, Pull-ups and pull-downs, capacitors, a sink ic, ype c port, etc.

# Use Case
    - IoT
    - AIoT
    - DIY Robotics
    - Research
    - And more!
